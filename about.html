            <p> Welcome to Penoyer Builders, INC. The only place you'll need to visit in planning your new home or renovation. Penoyer has been here in central New York for four generations. Originally building pole barns and other farm structures in the Manlius-Cazenovia Area, we eventually expanded construction by taking on home remodeling. We incorporated the business in 1967, an dincluded more new home construction, which, together with renovations, makes up most of our business today. We still do agricultural structures and some light commercial buildings, as well. Lead carpenters and schedulers meet together at least once a day to keep each other updated on all prjects. This makes for a truly collaborative effort. For you, our customer, it means that whoever answers your phone call knows who you are and is involved in your project.</p>
